<p style="font-size:30px">Oh, hello ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;I'm Reese, a full-stack web developer with a background in marketing. Currently seeking new opportunities, preferably either remote or somewhere on the west coast (Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, etc.).</p>

<p style="font-size:30px">During my time at Lambda I gained valuable experience working with a wide variety of technologies, including: React, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, Python, LESS/SASS, Redux, Jest, SQL, Gatsby, Knex, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.</p>

<p style="font-size:30px">I'm passionate about the creative aspect of web development and the ability it has to bring your ideas to fruition; I love coming up with new ways to implement technologies I've learned to make a positive societal impact. After all, "life's most persistent and urgent question is: what are you doing for others?" - Martin Luther King Jr. </p>
