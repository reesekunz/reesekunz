<p style="font-size:30px">Now based in Portland, Oregon, I'm a full-stack web developer and technical writer that also has a background in marketing from the University of Arizona. Currently I'm working as a developer at a startup called Gemint and also recently obtained a technical writing certificate through Oregon State University.</p>

<p style="font-size:30px">During my time as a student at the coding bootcamp Lambda School (now called BloomTech) I gained valuable experience working with technologies such as ReactJS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Python.</p>
